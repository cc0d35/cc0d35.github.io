I've been recently playing [American Fugitive](https://store.steampowered.com/app/934780/American_Fugitive/)
and I've enjoyed it quite a bit. A nice callback to old GTAs with a serviceable story, fun mechanics
but IMO lacking a bit in the combat system. Overall recommended.

So that's my review. Trying to get the most out of the game was fun, so naturally as a completionist
I wanted to explore what it takes to 100% the game.

Let's look at the [Steam achievements](https://steamcommunity.com/stats/934780/achievements).
There are of course a couple of them you will complete with the story, a nice metric for the developers of
how many players were engaged by the game and the story to complete it.

But let's skip dwelling on the fact that 77.2% of owners completed the first mission and only 8.1%
completed the story. I wanna get **all** the achievements, so let's look at the most diffcult ones.

## Challenges and time trials

> Complete all challenges and time trials with golden medals.

Honestly easy. Upon failing the first time trial horribly I began to feel scared, but the rest of them
was easy to challenging, only like two of them were hard.

But I am about to lose my mind.


## No Stone Left Unturned

> Find every hidden stash.

The game contains 100 hidden stashes (maybe a callback to some collectibles in 3D GTAs?).
Finding them all can be a terrible timesink. After completing the story, I found around 60
of them, not yet knowing if I wanted to find them all. Some of them are locked behind
coded safes for which the code can be found out by reading hints scattered around the map.

The coded safes were fun, since the hints often contain a small puzzle. For example, one
combination is "the year our grandmother died", for which you will need to find out
the name of the family and finally go to the graveyard to read her headstone.

The ones without hints... well... they sucked. A floating package in GTA Vice City,
a floating horseshoe in GTA:SA or a bright note in Banjo Kazooie is easy to spot.
Cracked wall in Zelda games is a bit more hidden but a piece of uneven ground blending
into the surrounding soil or pigeons perching on a piece of railing
(200 of them? Really GTA:IV?) are bullshot. 

So hiding a stash behind the trees in a fixed camera perspective is a sure way to
force players to just reach for an online map that some blessed soul spend days making
and spend hours having it opened on a second monitor and trying to discern where the heck
is the stash hidden.

Finding the rest of them took me about an hour and twenty minutes.


## Stick Up Artist

> Hold up 50 businesses.

Having looked at the stats screen and seeing that I stuck up only 13 times had me worried.
But I found a place with three businesses nearby each other. Each stick up took me about
30 seconds with about 10 seconds of travel time, so on the whole about 30 minutes.


## Gone In 60 Seconds

> Steal 200 cars.

After completing pretty much all of the other achievements, the stat "Cars stolen" was at 86.
After spending 20 minutes at a car rental agency and breaking into every car there,
having to find more crowbars to use to break into more cars, I gave up at 115.


## One Track Mind and Rollin', Rollin', Rollin'

> Destroy 100 Enemy Tanks and Crush 250 Vehicles with a Tank.

These two achievements were going to break me. On a good rampage, I can get around
1 to 2 tanks per minute (if they decide to spawn - I once went for 5 minutes without a tank!)
and crush 2 to 3 cars per minute. Using simple math and most optimistic predictions, I get:

> max(50 minutes, 84 minutes) = 84 minutes

84 minutes when the spawns are good, my tank doesn't get stuck on the crushed car (happens a lot BTW).

That's where I decided to cheat. 

---

## Strategy of Cheating

When cheating, I basically have two options:

- manipulating the memory of game
- manipulating the save file

I decided to go with the save file, because I was tired of memory manipulation,
where one value might be in multiple locations, referencing stale object not yet
garbage collected or where one value is used for displaying and the other
is the actual value and then looking for the accessors in ASM and finding the 
pointer references and...

Yeah, save files.


### Find the save file

Since I am running the game through SteamPlay/Proton I will look in the wine prefix.

```cmd
$ cd ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/
$ ls
[...a lot of directories with just numbers as names...]
```

Oh, I need the Steam AppID. It's the number in Steam's url.

```cmd
$ echo "https://store.steampowered.com/app/934780/American_Fugitive/" | grep -Eo "([0-9]+)"
934780
$ cd ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/934780/pfx/drive_c/
$ find -name "*Fugitive*"
./users/steamuser/Temp/Fallen Tree Games Ltd/American Fugitive
./users/steamuser/AppData/LocalLow/Fallen Tree Games Ltd/American Fugitive
```

The `Temp` dir will be temporary files, lets ignore it.

```cmd
$ cd ./users/steamuser/AppData/LocalLow/Fallen Tree Games Ltd/American Fugitive
$ tree .

Let's ignore the Unity debug and analytics stuff and I'm left with:

```cmd
SaveGame
├── Profile
│   ├── PlayerProfile.dat.bson
│   └── steam_autocloud.vdf
└── SceneMap_default
     ├── AllManagers.dat.bson
     └── steam_autocloud.vdf
```

### SaveGame/Profile/PlayerProfile.dat.bson

```cmd
$ vim SaveGame/Profile/PlayerProfile.dat.bson
```

reveals I'm probably dealing with a binary format with some some ASCII
inbetween. Seeing such strings as `KeyboardDefaultRemap` and `LockFPS`,
I see that these are probably global settings and move on.

### SaveGame/SceneMap_default/AllManagers.dat.bson
 
```cmd
$ vim SaveGame/SceneMap_default/AllManagers.dat.bson
```

Bingo. Inbetween binary junk I see 

- `MGR_PLAYERPERSISTANTDATA.Cash`
- `MGR_TIME_OF_DAY.totalGameTimeInMinutes`

Lets open the file in something more suited for viewing binary.

```cmd
$ xxd SaveGame/SceneMap_default/AllManagers.dat.bson
[...bunch of hex...]
```

Okay, thats a lot. First of all, I search for "[C|c]ars"

```cmd
$ xxd SaveGame/SceneMap_default/AllManagers.dat.bson | grep -i cars
00007240: 7200 0000 0000 00c0 6540 0143 6172 7353  r.......e@.CarsS
```

`CarsS` what? Lets see more output:

```cmd
$ xxd SaveGame/SceneMap_default/AllManagers.dat.bson | grep -A2 -i cars
00007240: 7200 0000 0000 00c0 6540 0143 6172 7353  r.......e@.CarsS
00007250: 746f 6c65 6e00 0000 0000 00c0 5c40 0148  tolen.......\@.H
00007260: 6967 6865 7374 5261 6d70 6167 6500 0000  ighestRampage...
```

`CarsStolen`, nice. Since I will be looking at the dump a lot, lets see
some surrounding lines:

```cmd
$ xxd SaveGame/SceneMap_default/AllManagers.dat.bson | grep -B3 -A3 -i cars
00007210: 4f63 6375 7069 6564 5665 6869 636c 6573  OccupiedVehicles
00007220: 546f 7765 6400 0000 0000 0000 0040 0154  Towed........@.T
00007230: 6f70 5370 6565 6446 6c61 6d69 6e67 4361  opSpeedFlamingCa
00007240: 7200 0000 0000 00c0 6540 0143 6172 7353  r.......e@.CarsS
00007250: 746f 6c65 6e00 0000 0000 00c0 5c40 0148  tolen.......\@.H
00007260: 6967 6865 7374 5261 6d70 6167 6500 0000  ighestRampage...
00007270: 0000 0000 3240 0143 6976 696c 6961 6e4b  ....2@.CivilianK
```

I am starting to see a pattern! Let's rearrange the hexdump a bit:

```
OccupiedVehiclesTowed     00 0000 0000 0000 0040 01
TopSpeedFlamingCar        00 0000 0000 00c0 6540 01
CarsStolen                00 0000 0000 00c0 5c40 01
HighestRampage            00 0000 0000 0000 3240 01
```

`40 01` repeats, so I _assume_ (we might touch on that later) that
it probably is just a separator. Aligning the hexdump, I get:

```
OccupiedVehiclesTowed     00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
TopSpeedFlamingCar        00 00 00 00 00 00 c0 65
CarsStolen                00 00 00 00 00 00 c0 5c
HighestRampage            00 00 00 00 00 00 00 32
```

These values probably correspond to the ingame stats, seen here:

<Image alt="Stats screen" src={imgStatsBeginning} />

Assume:

- `OccupiedVehiclesTowed` = "Occupied Vehicles Towed"     = 2
- `TopSpeedFlamingCar`    = _not present in stats screen_
- `CarsStolen`            = "Cars stolen"                 = 115
- `HighestRampage`        = _not present in stats screen_

Next, converting the binary to human readable data.

The binary value is 8 bytes long, this leaves us with a couple of options
of its data type (assuming all of them have the same data type)

LE (little endian)
- 1x 8 bytes `double`
- 1x 8 bytes `int64` or `long`
- 2x 4 bytes `float`
- 2x 4 bytes `int`
- ... couple of others, like 8x 1 byte char, but those are unlikely

BE (big endian)
- 1x 8 bytes `double`
- 1x 8 bytes `int64` or `long`
- 2x 4 bytes `float`
- 2x 4 bytes `int`
- ... couple of others, like 8x 1 byte char, but those are unlikely

**Drumroll please...**

```
                  Exp |   dblLE |   dblBE |               i64LE | i64BE |
OVT [00..] 00 00    2 |     0.0 |     0.0 |                   0 |     0 |
CS  [00..] c0 5c  115 | ~2e-319 | ~5e+138 | 6683341847017816064 | 49244 |
```

The rest is not included, since it's similar nonsense.

This doesn't seem right. What the hell is up with this binary number?

**What does `c05c` mean???**


### .bson - seems like a familiar extension?

Some pieces of software use extensions to help with identifying the file type.
Since `file` doens't seem to recognize the save file as anything but binary

```cmd
$ file SaveGame/SceneMap_default/AllManagers.dat.bson
SaveGame/SceneMap_default/AllManagers.dat.bson: data
```

I will assume that `.bson` will have some meaning. Seems familiar to `.json`...

[Googling `bson`](https://www.google.com/search?q=bson) gives me a Wikipedia definition:

> BSON is a computer data interchange format.
> The name "BSON" is based on the term JSON and stands for "Binary JSON".
> It is a binary form for representing simple or complex data structures including
> associative arrays, integer indexed arrays, and a suite of fundamental scalar types.
> BSON originated in 2009 at MongoDB.

Ah, OK, a database binary type stuff. Lets google for a parser or a spec

- https://www.google.com/search?q=bson+parser
- https://github.com/mongodb/js-bson `[specification]`
- https://bsonspec.org/
- https://bsonspec.org/spec.html

Oh, the standard looks pretty easy. But for my sanity's sake, I will just use the premade parser.


### bson parser

Let's grab the package from `npm` and use it:

```cmd
$ take bson-parser
$ npm init
$ npm install --save bson
$ cp package.json tmp && jq '.+{"type":"module"}' package.json > tmp && mv tmp package.json 
```

<FilenameForCodeblock filename="./parse.js"/>
```js
import fs from 'node:fs/promises';
import {deserialize} from 'bson';

const SAVEFILE = process.env.HOME + '/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/934780/pfx' +
  '/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/LocalLow/Fallen Tree Games Ltd' +
  '/American Fugitive/SaveGame/SceneMap_default/AllManagers.dat.bson'; 

(async () => {
  try {
    await fs.access(SAVEFILE, fs.constants.R_OK);
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(`Cannot access file ${SAVEFILE}`);
    return 1;
  }

  const saveData = await fs.readFile(SAVEFILE);
  const deserialized = deserialize(saveData);

  console.dir(deserialized);
  await fs.writeFile('./parsed-savefile.json', JSON.stringify(deserialized));
})().then(c => process.exit(c));
```

```cmd
$ node ./parse.js
{
  'MGR_PLAYERPERSISTANTDATA.Cash': 39562,
  MGR_PLAYERPERSISTANTDATAUpgradePoints: 20,
  RespawnCount: 0,
  Unlocks: {
[... a lot more keys and values ...]
  }
}
```

Looks nice. Let's poke around some keys to figure out what I can do
and add some comments on what might the values be representing:

```cmd
$ jq '. |= keys' parsed-savefile.json
[
  # Keys like `8aad93885f9dbdd44bfdaa8189b04272_10_data.SpecificUnlocks` skipped

  "MetalDetectorEnabled",                    # Self-explanatory
  "Minigun",                                 # Amount of minigun ammo

  "RespawnCount",                            # How many times has the character respawned
  "RespawnOnObjectiveCount",                 # No clue
  "Rifle",                                   # Amount of rifle ammo

  "Shotgun",                                 # Amount of shotgun ammo
  "Unlocks",                                 # List of upgrades and their levels
  "WornClothing"                             # UUID of worn clothes item
]
```

Although some of these values have unknown purpose, it's nice seeing English being used
(I worked on a French codebase once).

A whole lot of talk and no savefile editing! Let's fix that!


### Editing the save file

Since there is no checksum, the following should work:

<FilenameForCodeblock filename="./parse.js"/>
```js
import fs from 'node:fs/promises';
import {deserialize, serialize} from 'bson';

const SAVEFILE = process.env.HOME + '/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/934780/pfx' +
  '/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/LocalLow/Fallen Tree Games Ltd' +
  '/American Fugitive/SaveGame/SceneMap_default/AllManagers.dat.bson'; 

(async () => {
  try {
    await fs.access(SAVEFILE, fs.constants.R_OK);
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(`Cannot access file ${SAVEFILE}`);
    return 1;
  }

  const saveData = await fs.readFile(SAVEFILE);
  const deserialized = deserialize(saveData);

  deserialized['MGR_PLAYERPERSISTANTDATA.Cash'] = 999999;

  const serialized = serialize(deserialized);
  await fs.writeFile('./savegame.gson', serialized);
})().then(c => process.exit(c));
```

```cmd
$ node ./parse.js
$ cp "${PATH_TO_SAVE}" AllManagers.dat.bson.bak
$ cp savegame.gson "${PATH_TO_SAVE}"
```

I ran American Fugitive and... nothing! My cash kept resetting back!

> **This took me 30 minutes to debug.**

Oh yeah, I forgot to disable Steam Cloud saves. D'oh!


### Cheating Like a King

Lets change some more of the values:

<FilenameForCodeblock filename="./parse.js"/>
```js
import fs from 'node:fs/promises';
import {deserialize, serialize} from 'bson';

const SAVEFILE = process.env.HOME + '/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/934780/pfx' +
  '/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/LocalLow/Fallen Tree Games Ltd' +
  '/American Fugitive/SaveGame/SceneMap_default/AllManagers.dat.bson'; 

(async () => {
  try {
    await fs.access(SAVEFILE, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK);
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(`Cannot access file ${SAVEFILE}`);
    return 1;
  }

  const saveData = await fs.readFile(SAVEFILE);
  const deserialized = deserialize(saveData);

  console.dir(deserialized['MGR_STATSMGR.Stats']);

  deserialized['MGR_STATSMGR.Stats']['CarsStolen'] = 200;
  deserialized['MGR_STATSMGR.Stats']['AllFlyersFound'] = 15;
  deserialized['MGR_STATSMGR.Stats']['TanksDestroyed'] = 100;
  deserialized['MGR_STATSMGR.Stats']['VehiclesCrushedByTank'] = 250;

  deserialized['MGR_PLAYERPERSISTANTDATA.Cash'] = 999999;
  deserialized['MGR_PLAYERPERSISTANTDATAUpgradePoints'] = 99;
  deserialized['Rifle'] = 999;
  deserialized['Shotgun'] = 999;
  deserialized['Explosive'] = 999;
  deserialized['Minigun'] = 999;
  deserialized['Handgun'] = 999;
  deserialized['SMG'] = 999;
  deserialized['CurrentHealth'] = 999;

  const serialized = serialize(deserialized);
  await fs.writeFile(SAVEFILE, serialized);
})().then(c => process.exit(c));
```

Then running the game again

<Image alt="All achievements unlocked on the same day" src={imgAchievementsUnlocked}/>

Nice.


### Making an editor

Why not? Let's spin the framework wheel... **Solid JS**

```cmd
$ npx degit solidjs/templates/ts-bootstrap american-fugitive-save-editor
$ ~/c0d3s/useful-scripts/git-config-repo.sh
$ code .
$ pnpm install
$ pnpm run dev
```

Adding some bits of coding here and there and I have a complete editor!

You can see the complete code on [GitHub](https://github.com/cc0d35/american-fugitive-save-editor).


## Conclusion

I tried editing a single value in an unknown binary and I failed.

I used a library for parsing the binary and made a whole save editor.
It was a fun practice round I guess...

See ya.
